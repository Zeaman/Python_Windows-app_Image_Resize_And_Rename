# Image Resize and Rename Tool
## Description
This Python application provides a simple and user-friendly GUI for resizing and renaming images in bulk. The tool is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface and the Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation.

## Features
- Resize multiple images simultaneously to a specified width and height.
- Rename the resized images with a new naming convention.
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.

## Usage
1. Download the repository or clone it to your local machine.
2. Run the executable file (`Main_Resize_Rename.exe`) on Windows or execute the Python script directly (`Main_Resize_Rename.py` on other platforms).
3. The GUI will prompt you to provide the source folder, target width, and target height.
4. Click the "Submit" button to initiate the resizing and renaming process.
5. A success message will be displayed once all files are successfully processed.
